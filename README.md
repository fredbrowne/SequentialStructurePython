12. Having as data input the height of a person, build an algorithm that calculates the ideal weight, using the following formula: (72.7*height) - 58

13. Having as data input the height (h) of a person, build an algorithm that calculates the ideal weight, using the following formulas:   
    To men: (72.7*h) - 58
    To women: (62.1*h) - 44.7

14. John Fisher-Talk, good man, bought a microcomputer to control his daily income. 
    Everytime he brings fish that weights more then the regulation of São Paulo state (50 kilos) it needs to pay
    a fee of R$ 4.00 for every excess kilo.
    John needs you to write a program that would read a variable weight (fish weight) and calculate the excess.
    Save into excess variable the quantity of kilos beyond the limit and in variable fee the value of the tax
    John will have to pay. Print the data of the program with appropriate messages. 

15. Make a program that will ask you how much you make by the hour and number of hours worked in a month. Calculate and display the Gross Salary for that month, knowing that the following discounts should be added 11% for FISCO Tax, 8% for INSS and 5% for the union, make a program that shows:
    gross salary.
    how much INSS tax.
    how much for the union.
    net salary.
    calculate the discounts and net salary using below information:
    + Gross Salary : R$
    - IR (11%) : R$
    - INSS (8%) : R$
    - Union ( 5%) : R$
    = Net Salary : R$
    Obs.: Gross Salary - Discounts = Net Salary.

16. Make a program for a paint store. The program shall ask for the size of square meters of the area to be painted. Consider that the paint cover is 1 liter to every 3 square meters and the paint is sold in cans of 18 liters, that cost  R$ 80,00. Inform the user the quantity of paint cans to be bought and the the full price.

17. Faça um Programa para uma loja de tintas. O programa deverá pedir o tamanho em metros quadrados da área a ser pintada. Considere que a cobertura da tinta é de 1 litro para cada 6 metros quadrados e que a tinta é vendida em latas de 18 litros, que custam R$ 80,00 ou em galões de 3,6 litros, que custam R$ 25,00.
    Informe ao usuário as quantidades de tinta a serem compradas e os respectivos preços em 3 situações:
    comprar apenas latas de 18 litros;
    comprar apenas galões de 3,6 litros;
    misturar latas e galões, de forma que o preço seja o menor. Acrescente 10% de folga e sempre arredonde os valores para cima, isto é, considere latas cheias.

18. Faça um programa que peça o tamanho de um arquivo para download (em MB) e a velocidade de um link de Internet (em Mbps), calcule e informe o tempo aproximado de download do arquivo usando este link (em minutos).
