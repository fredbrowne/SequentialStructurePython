## List of Exercises

The exercises are separated by number. Here is the description of each:

```
1. Make a program that will say Hello World

2. Make a program that will ask for a number and then show a message The Number informed was

3. Make a program that will ask two numbers and print the sum

4. Make a program that will take 4 grades and show the grade points average.

5. Make a program that will convert meters into centimeters

6. Make a program that will ask the radius of a circule, calculate and show its area

7. Make a program that calculates the area of a square, and show the double of the area for the user.

8. Make a program that will ask how much you make by the hour and the number o hours you worked in a month. Calculate and show the total of your income for that month.

9. Make a program that will take the temperature in Farenheit, convert and show it in Celsius.

10. Make a Program that will take the temperature in Celsius, convert and show in Farenheit.

11. Make a program that will ask for 2 integers and 1 float. Calculate and show:
        the product of the double for the first with half the second
        sum the triple of the first with the third
        third cubed.

12. Having as data input the height of a person, build an algorithm that calculates the ideal weight, using the following formula: (72.7*height) - 58

13. Having as data input the height (h) of a person, build an algorithm that calculates the ideal weight, using the following formulas:   
    To men: (72.7*h) - 58
    To women: (62.1*h) - 44.7

14. John Fisher-Talk, good man, bought a microcomputer to control his daily income. 
    Everytime he brings fish that weights more then the regulation of SÃ£o Paulo state (50 kilos) it needs to pay
    a fee of R$ 4.00 for every excess kilo.
    John needs you to write a program that would read a variable weight (fish weight) and calculate the excess.
    Save into excess variable the quantity of kilos beyond the limit and in variable fee the value of the tax
    John will have to pay. Print the data of the program with appropriate messages. 

15. Make a program that will ask you how much you make by the hour and number of hours worked in a month. Calculate and display the Gross Salary for that month, knowing that the following discounts should be added 11% for FISCO Tax, 8% for INSS and 5% for the union, make a program that shows:
    gross salary.
    how much INSS tax.
    how much for the union.
    net salary.
    calculate the discounts and net salary using below information:
    + Gross Salary : R$
    - IR (11%) : R$
    - INSS (8%) : R$
    - Union ( 5%) : R$
    = Net Salary : R$
    Obs.: Gross Salary - Discounts = Net Salary.

16. Make a program for a paint store. The program shall ask for the size of square meters of the area to be painted. Consider that the paint cover is 1 liter to every 3 square meters and the paint is sold in cans of 18 liters, that cost  R$ 80,00. Inform the user the quantity of paint cans to be bought and the the full price.

17. Make a program for a paint store. The program shall ask for the size of square meters of the area to be painted. Consider that the paint cover is 1 litre to every 6 square meters and the paint is sold in cans of 18 litres, that cost  R$ 80,00, or gallons of 3,6 litres, that cost R$ 25,00. 
    Inform the user the quantity of paint cans to be bought and the the full price in 3 scenarios:
    Buy only cans of 18 litres;
    Buy only gallons of 3,6 litres;
    mix cans and gallons, so that the price is cheaper. Add 10% and round the values up, considering as full cans.

18. Create a program that asks the size of a file to download (in MB) and the connection speed (in Mbps), calculate and inform the approximate time to download the file using this link (in minutes).
